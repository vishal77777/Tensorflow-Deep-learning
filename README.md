In this i will be uploading Colab notebooks related to deep learning.
Till now i've covered: 
## ANN

1. regression
2. classification

Hyper parameter tunning: fro regression

1. optimizers = Adam,SGD 
2. tunning the number of layers,neurons to get optimized solution
3. learning rate
4. actication function = "relu"
5. loss function = mae , mse

Datasets = [Own sample,Boston,Medical insurance]


Later will cover : 
1. Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Network
2. Transfer learning 
3. NLP (Natural Language Processing)
